The "Final Project Pages" folder contains the files from the 
defense earlier today. These are probably more stable and they were the files originally presented.

The "POST-DEFENSE Pages" folder contains a few edited pages, which incorporate a few new features.
One of the important additions is input checking to prevent creation of inappropriate accounts.
However, these features are new and were implemented quickly and have thus not been thoroughly tested
(though in terms of core functionality, they already work). Further improvements with regard to error messages
and handling to be added in the future.

The word file "Final Documents" contains the documentation for the project (this is the file that was printed
and binded and was submitted earlier).
